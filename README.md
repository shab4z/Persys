# Persys

Persys is a toolkit designed to automate to simulate the implementation
of persistence mechanisms on Windows environments.
This project has been developed **for educational purposes only**.  
Each module represents one persistence technique with specific parameters. Some  
modules requires administrative privileges on the targeted system.
